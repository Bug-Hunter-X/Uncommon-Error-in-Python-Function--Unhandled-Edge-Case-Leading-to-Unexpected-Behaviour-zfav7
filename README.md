This repository showcases a Python function containing a subtle error that might lead to unexpected behaviour in certain scenarios.  The function appears to handle division-by-zero situations but misses a critical edge case. This example highlights the importance of thorough testing and edge case consideration in software development. The solution demonstrates how to robustly handle this specific edge case and prevent potential issues.
